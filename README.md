# rust_spell
A basic spelling game in Rust programing language

Description:
- The user enters the words they want to practice.

- The user tries to write the word they hear in a proper way.

### Motivation:
- My little sister studying English and I'm rust :) The basic program was for her. (So I studied strings in rust.)
