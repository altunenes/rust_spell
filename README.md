# rust_spell
A basic spelling game in Rust programing language

Description:
- The user enters the words they want to practice.

- The user tries to write the word they hear in a proper way.
- Print /exit to exit the program and it prints the score and statistics of the game.
- You can play with "word_list.txt" file that contains a list of words. You can add your own words to the file. If you want to play with "word_list.txt" file, print "2" and enter on the console when the program asks you to play mode.

### Motivation:
- My little sister studying English and I'm rust :) The basic program was for her. (So I studied strings in rust.)
