# rusty_spelling
A basic spelling game in Rust programing language

Description:
- The user enters the words they want to practice.

- The user tries to write the word they hear in a proper way.
- Print /exit to exit the program and it prints the score and statistics of the game.
- You can play with "word_list.txt" file that contains a list of words. You can add your own words to the file.

### Usage/Installation:
- You need to install rust on your computer. You can install it from [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

- Open a terminal window and navigate to your project directory. Run the following command:
  
```bash
cargo build --release
```

- This will compile your code and create an executable in the "target/release/rust_spell.exe" directory.


- You can simply the run executable file by double-clicking on it. 


- Or open the project folder in your terminal and write the cargo run command.
  
```bash
cargo run
```

This will compile and run the program.

### Motivation:
- My little sister studying English and I'm rust :). The basic program was for her. (So I studied strings in rust.)

#### Future, in progress:

- Working on a web version via wasm.
